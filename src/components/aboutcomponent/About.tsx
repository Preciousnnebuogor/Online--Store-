          Perfection is a male online shopping site founded by Miss Precious
          Nnebuogor, in the year 2023. We estimate the size of the global
          streetwear market at USD $185 billion in annual sales, making it by
          some estimates about 10% of the entire global apparel and footwear
          market. Streetwear’s impact – both on retail culture and the numbers
          involved – has caught the attention of some of the most iconic,
          established brands in the retail, luxury goods, and fashion industry
          in general

          As we have got an idea about the effectiveness of the eCommerce
          industry above. And especially in this Covid-19 pandemic situation, we
          have seen its most effects. Customers now feel comfortable, and also
          have their dependency on buying all the luxury to all the necessary
          things from online clothing stores. So it’s a well-timed decision to
          start your online clothing store.
